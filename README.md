# BookOfWar
Simulator and price-balancer for the OED Book of War tabletop game.

A simple but robust implementation of mass warfare for classic D&D systems.

See usage output for some guidance on use.

Caution: This is compute intensive, and will use up all available processor cores, spawning a separate thread per unit-on-unit game series.
Performance is more efficient with larger trial values (less thread-switching; see -t switch).
